 Deployment

MemoryMate is deployed via Convex, which hosts both backend and frontend.

 Production

Deploy to Production

npx convex deploy

This uploads all backend logic and the frontend (if configured) to Convex's production environment.

Convex auto-generates .env.local and uses a separate dev deployment.

No manual .env editing is needed between environments.
